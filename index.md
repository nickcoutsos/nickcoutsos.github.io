# About

I'm a software engineer based in Toronto.

I like building things, digital and otherwise.

Professionally I'm a full stack developer using React and Node (or Python) with
a preferential leaning towards back end services, but for personal projects I'm
often drawn to browser technologies I don't normally get to interact with.

## Personal Projects

In my spare time I'll work on whatever piques my curiosity. See a selection of
my projects below for an idea of what interests me and how much time I'm willing
to sink into it.
